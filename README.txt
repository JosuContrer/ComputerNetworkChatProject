OBJECTIVE
---------
    The projects main objective was to implement a chat application
that handled multiple clients with one running server. The main
feature that this chat application provides is a server that can
handle multiple connection requests and disconnect requests, direct
messaging/whispering between clients, and validation of client usernames.
These requests must be handled properly as to not disrupt the running
services at the server and client ends. This means that proper testing
mitigates these errors as they are caught and handled properly beforehand.


TESTED ON
---------
    This program was implemented on the latest Java 8 release with Junit 4.13


RUINING THE APPLICATION
-----------------------
* There are two ways to run this application *
1) Run the Server.java file in the Backend Folder
    Then run the ClientGUI.java in the Frontend Folder

2) Run the server.jar and client.jar files using terminal
    that can be found in the out folder
